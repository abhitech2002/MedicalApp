  "description": "Create a medical app backend with the following capabilities: 1. Data management: Create a database to keep track of patient data, physician information, and uploaded medical reports. Create   useful schemas to efficiently organize and store the data. 2. RESTful API endpoints should be created in order to manage CRUD operations for patients, physicians, and reports. Create endpoints that can be used to create, read, update, and delete entities. 3. Analyze the uploaded medical reports using deep learning or AI models to produce automated analytics. To process the reports and extract pertinent insights, implement backend logic. 4. Implement API endpoints to retrieve information about patients, doctors, and report analytics. Allow sorting and filtering options to improve user experience. 5. Data Validation: Check user input to make sure that all required fields are filled in and that it complies with any requirements, such as the data formats for medical reports or patient information. 6. Security: Adopt appropriate security measures to safeguard user data and guarantee confidentiality while adhering to pertinent laws governing the protection of patient data. 7. Provide detailed and understandable documentation for the backend API, detailing each endpoint's requirements for request payloads and expected responses.  --- Patients can upload and manage their medical reports using this straightforward medical app, view automated analytics, and communicate with doctors. Doctors have access to patient profiles, can look over reports, and can offer medical guidance or care. Deep learning or AI models are used in the backend to analyze reports and produce insights. Once the core functionalities are implemented, additional features like appointment scheduling, chat functionality, or notifications can be added as upgrades.",
